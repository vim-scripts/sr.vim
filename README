This is a syntax highlighting script for synchronizing resources.
This language is mainly intended for educational use and I doubt anyone will find it useful for writing anything meant for widespread use.
You can find the homepage here http://www.cs.arizona.edu/sr/
and an excellent reference here http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/OSusingSR/

You could probably extend this script alot by specifying regions and clusters and stuff, but as I will probably never use the language again I didn't bother learning how to.
